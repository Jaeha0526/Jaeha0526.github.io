# Welcome

I'm a **theoretical physics Ph.D. candidate at Caltech** working with Professor Hirosi Ooguri, with a strong mathematical foundation and hands-on expertise in LLM development. I'm passionate about bridging physics and AI applications while fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Education

**Ph.D. in Physics, Caltech** *(Sep 2020 - present)*  
Advisor: Professor Hirosi Ooguri

**B.S. in Physics, Seoul National University** *(Mar 2014 - Aug 2020)*  
*Overall GPA: 4.01/4.30, Physics: 4.11/4.30 (summa cum laude)*

## Current Research Focus

I'm currently exploring the intersection of theoretical physics and artificial intelligence, with particular expertise in:

- **LLM Training & Fine-tuning**: GRPO, PPO, DPO, AlphaZero-style self-play based training
- **Agentic Systems**: Development using CrewAI, LangChain, and LLM scaffolding for tool use
- **AI Safety & Alignment**: Representation Engineering, automated red-teaming, jailbreak analysis
- **Physics Applications**: Using AI methods to solve problems in conformal field theory and beyond

## Recent Work

### Research Internship at Morph Labs *(Jan - Mar 2025)*
- Used reinforcement learning techniques to train language models for tool use and reasoning
- Developed training pipelines using imitation learning and policy optimization methods on coding benchmarks

### Key Projects
- **Representation Engineering for Character Control**: Multi-agent system for systematic LLM personality control through RepE
- **Enhanced Jailbreak Defense**: Extending Multi-Turn Human Jailbreaks dataset for improved LLM defenses
- **AlphaZero for Ramsey Numbers**: Using RL to bound mathematical constants through game theory
- **Algebraic Structure Discovery**: Novel BGRPO algorithm for polynomial decomposition (accepted to MOSS@ICML)

## Publications & Recognition

- **Physics Publications**: 3 papers in high-energy physics, including work on Conformal Field Theory and Kerr-AdS superradiant instability
- **Gold Medal**: International Physics Olympiad (2013)
- **James A. Cullen Memorial Fellowship**: Caltech (2021)
