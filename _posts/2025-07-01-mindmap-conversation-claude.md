## Mindmap-Like Conversation with Claude

Traditional conversations with AI follow a linear, back-and-forth pattern. But what if we could **branch out** and explore multiple conversation threads simultaneously? 

This Claude Artifact transforms the way we interact with AI by creating a **mindmap-like conversation interface** that breaks free from sequential constraints.

*This is just the beginning of what's possible when we reimagine the conversation interface. What other conversation paradigms could we explore?*
