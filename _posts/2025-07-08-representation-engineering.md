# An Agentic System for Performing Representation Engineering for Character Control

## Project Overview

This project implements an automated system for steering character of large language models (LLMs) via representation engineering techniques and guardrailing methods. Character or personality in LLMs has grown as both a new area of investigation into improving LLM performance and a practical consideration in affecting user interactions across multiple software platforms.

## Motivation

Character in LLMs is best described as a definite but changing set of tendencies, patterns, and values that reflect LLM-user interaction. As users increasingly personify LLMs across various platforms, the ability to systematically control and shape these personalities becomes crucial for:

- **User Experience**: Tailoring interactions to user preferences
- **Safety**: Ensuring appropriate discussion boundaries
- **Adaptability**: Maintaining necessary flexibility in responses
- **Consistency**: Providing reliable personality traits

## Technical Approach

### Representation Engineering
Our system utilizes representation engineering to primarily shape character by:
- Analyzing internal model representations
- Identifying key directions in embedding space
- Manipulating these representations to achieve desired character traits

### Guardrailing Methods
The guardrails ensure that character shaping:
- Stays within appropriate discussion frameworks
- Maintains necessary adaptability
- Prevents harmful or inappropriate personality expressions

### Agentic System Design
The automated system provides:
- **Systematic Control**: Consistent application of character modifications
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Dynamic adjustment based on context
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation of character traits

## Key Features

### 1. Automated Character Steering
- Real-time personality adjustment
- Consistent trait application
- Context-aware modifications

### 2. Positive Character Traits
The system focuses on enhancing positive characteristics while maintaining:
- Appropriate boundaries
- Ethical considerations
- User safety

### 3. Interdisciplinary Collaboration
This project demonstrates collaboration between:
- **Machine Learning**: Advanced representation techniques
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: User experience considerations
- **Ethics**: Responsible AI development

## Collaboration

**Team Members**: 
- Deepro Pasha (dpasha@caltech.edu)
- Ananya Gangavarapu (agangava@caltech.edu)
- Jaeha Lee (jaeha@caltech.edu)

**Institution**: California Institute of Technology

## Research Impact

This work contributes to the growing field of controllable AI systems by:
- Providing practical tools for character control
- Demonstrating the effectiveness of representation engineering
- Establishing frameworks for safe personality modification

### Applications
- **Chatbot Development**: Customizable AI assistants
- **Educational Tools**: Adaptive learning personalities
- **Customer Service**: Tailored interaction styles
- **Creative Applications**: Character-driven AI systems

## Future Directions

The project opens several avenues for future research:
- Scaling to larger language models
- More sophisticated guardrailing mechanisms
- Integration with other AI safety techniques
- User study validation
